# booking-web-app

<!-- basic booking web application for different hotels and nnumber of people being booked -->
there isnt much happening in this project other than a few api calls and basic routing for the pages, though  i may add some features later down the line for practice sake to make it more lean and better looking with a ffew backend fucntions like user authentication,email verifaction and sending users tickets to their emails with a few api calls
Right now it is just not pretty but feel free to add features and or functions to it
